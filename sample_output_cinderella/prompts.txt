Final prompt:
A young woman with flowing blonde hair and a tattered maid's dress stands in a rustic cottage kitchen. Gentle morning light streams through a small window, highlighting the dust particles floating in the air. The woman's delicate hands are slightly raised as she sings, her lips curved in a joyful smile despite her humble surroundings. Several bluebirds and robins hover around her, some perched on her shoulders or fingers, others in mid-flight. Their wings are captured in fluid motion, characteristic of classic cel animation techniques. The kitchen features worn wooden countertops, a stone hearth, and simple cooking implements. The colors are vibrant yet soft - primarily blues, yellows, and warm browns with clean black outlines defining each element. The scene has that distinctive hand-painted feel of traditional animation, with smooth gradients and simplified but expressive facial features.
